## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Answer:
Version Control also called source control system, is a system that keeps track of changes made to a file or a set of files. It track the history of file modification and allow multiple software teams to collaborate without overwriting each other's work. 
Github is popular because it's an open source tool that is widely-used that allows software developers to host their code online for free (eventhough it has paid version). Github is a repository to store, manage, make changes, exchange, and trade files especially code among software teams. It also facilitate collaborations, issues tracking, pull request, integration and automation, etc.
Version control helps in maintaining project integrity because there is room for consistency and traceability, this ensures that every changes is tracked, makes it easy to keep clear records. The ability of version control in recovery from mistakes also enhances the Project integrity. Team can also work on the same project at the same time without interferring with each other's work. platform like github helps with storing repositories, this helps to safeguard code against data loss.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Answer:
step 1: signin into your Github account. (You can download and install on your device if you don't have one yet, then signup)
step 2: click on the + button in the upper right corner, and select "New Repository".
step 3: Choose a name for the repository. You can write a short description for the repository, but this is totally optional.
step 4: Select public or private (depending on your choice)
step 5: Initialize the repository by selecting preferred button of any of the following
a. Initialize with a README
b. .gitignore file
c. Choose a license
Step 6: Create the repository by clicking on the "create repository" button.
Some of the important decisions to consider when creating a new repository are:
1. Repository name: Choose the best name that suit project in which the repository is created for, so as to avoid confusion later and for easy references.
2. Public or Private: Who should have access to the file is very important, it could be for public access or private access.
3. README file: This contains important information about the file. It also, helps other developers to have idea about the purpose of the file.
4. .gitignore file: To ignore uneccessary or sentisive files out of repository.
5. License: This determines how others can legally use code.
   
## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
Answer: 
README file describes the nessecary information that developers needs to know to collaorate and contribute to a project on github. The README file is a detailed description of the project, this guides developers on what it's expected of the project and the best way to contribute to the project, meanwhile, the primary reason for a README file is to serve as a documentation guide for the project.
A well written README file should have project title and description, table of contents, installation guides, usage instructions, configuration options, contributing guidelines, license, credit and acknowlegment, contact information, Limitation and bugs, etc.
README file contributed greatly to effective collaoration, because, it help to set expectation and purpose of the project which helps every member of the team or contributors in understanding the project's goals, structures and standards. README file also enhances the onboarding process of the project by educating collaborators on the aims and goals of the project. It also promote consistency and encourage contributions. 

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Answer:
Public repository is open and accessible to everyone on the internet. It can the downloaded, forked, and cloned by any github user.
Advantages:
1. It encourages open collaborations and contributions.
2. It promote visibility and exposure.
3. It enhances crowdsource improvement.
4. It's relatively easy to maintain and free to create.
Disadvantages:
1. Lack of viewer's control because everyone on the internet can view and download it.
2. Lack of quality control because not all  open contribution may meet the quality desired of the project.
3. It can pose security risk because public repositories are more susceptible to vulneranilities.
   
Private repository on the other hand can only be accessed by the creator, people and organization that were granted access to. Only people with permission can view, contribute, and clone the project.
